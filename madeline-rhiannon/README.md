# Blog Ajax JSON

**Author**: Rhiannon Mortensen && Madeline Peters
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Today we are stopping the articles from rendering on page load and instead using Ajax to load them. 

## Getting Started
The user must open the GitHUb repository and open the files in their browser.

## Architecture
VS Code, HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery, Ajax, JSON, Handlebars.

## Credits and Collaborations
--> Megan Flood helped us ALOT in understanding what we were doing wrong with the if/else statement we needed to complete at the bottom of the page

--> Nicholas Carignan helped with where we are to call our function and why they need to be that way.
      oh, he also helped us understand what order our scripts need to be in order to render properly.
